I released version 0.0.1, and the tool is now available on [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```
brew install kendfinger/tools/virtual
```

I intend to, over the course of the next few days, add a few subcommands to help with downloading distributions, and perhaps a friendly mode that will run Ubuntu/Fedora/etc. on demand. I've also considered adding a daemon mode that you can connect to.

If anyone has any feature requests, please feel free to file them as an issue. The [Goals wiki page](https://github.com/kendfinger/virtual/wiki/Goals) contains some of my thoughts around the project and where I intend to go with it.
