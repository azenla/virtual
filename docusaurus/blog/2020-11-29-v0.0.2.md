New release v0.0.2 available now on Homebrew or the [Github releases page](https://github.com/kendfinger/virtual/releases).  This version adds the `--macaddr` (or `-a`) argument so that you can specify the virtual machine ethernet adapter's MAC address.  Without this flag present, the MAC address will be assigned randomly on every boot, which can make network operation troublesome.
